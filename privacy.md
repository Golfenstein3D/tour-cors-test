## 1. Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It

We collect data from you directly, automatically when you visit or use the Topgolf Offerings and through cookies and other technologies, and sometimes from third parties.
Some of this data may be considered "personal information" or "personal data," some of which may be considered "sensitive," under various applicable laws.
We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal data (such as your name, phone number, email address, etc.), and we treat additional data, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal data" where required by applicable law.

Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a "hash."
We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements.
We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.
If we combine data that we consider to be non-personal with personal data, we will treat that combined data as personal data under this Privacy Notice.

The following chart sets out the category of personal data collected ("**Category**"), the purposes for which the data is collected ("**A. Purposes**"), the categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed for a business purpose ("**B. Disclosed To**"), and the categories of third parties to whom the data may be sold for monetary value or other valuable consideration or shared for cross context behavioral advertising/targeted advertising ("**C. Sold/Shared To**").

Please also see Section 2, [Additional Details About Our Data Practices](#T2) below the chart for additional information on certain types of personal data collection and use.

<a id="T2a"></a>

### a. Data Collected Automatically: Device ID/Interaction Information

When you interact with us through the Topgolf Offerings online, we and our third party business partners automatically collect and/or store certain information about your device when you visit or interact with the Topgolf Offerings ("**Device ID/Information**") and information about your activity on those Topgolf Offerings.
This Device ID/Information may be stored and/or accessed from your computer, tablet, mobile device, or other device whenever you visit or interact with the Topgolf Offerings.
Device ID/Information may include, but is not limited to:

- Your IP address, mobile device identifier and other unique identifier
- Device information, including device model, operating system version, device date and time, mobile network information
- Approximate location of your device, which may be collected or inferred through other data we collect, such as IP address
- How you use and interact with the Topgolf Offerings, including your search terms, pages you visit, content you view, videos you watch, your preferences, and any other information you provide through chat or community forum features or submit through online forms

**Precise and Approximate Location Data.**
We may collect specific data about your location from your device.
This may include your precise location.
We may collect this using different types of technologies, including GPS and Wi-Fi.
If you use our mobile app, we may also access your device's location data in the background.
You may be able to turn off the collection of location data through your device settings.
However, please note that we may still be able to collect or infer your approximate location through other data we collect, such as IP address.
In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with data regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Topgolf Offerings.
Device ID/Interaction Information may be collected through the use of the following technologies:

**Cookies and Local Storage.**
The online Topgolf Offerings use cookies and related technologies ("**Cookies**") to enhance the browsing and usage experience on our online Topgolf Offerings.
"Cookies" are small files or records that are placed on a visitor's device or browser (by a third party or us) to collect data about your activities on our online Topgolf Offerings.
Cookies may be used for many purposes by us and third parties, such as:

- To speed up navigation and provide you with custom-tailored content.
- To remember the information you gave to us, so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the online Topgolf Offerings.
- To monitor the effectiveness of certain marketing email campaigns.
- To monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and banners served on our online Topgolf Offerings.
- To enforce limitations on downloads described for online coupons and other similar offers.
- To automatically collect Device ID/Information.
- To enable features.
- To serve behavioral based advertisements.
- For analytics.
- To market our products and services to you.
- As detailed below, we also allow certain partners to place Cookies on our online Topgolf Offerings to provide personalized marketing to you.
  You can find more information about Cookies and how they work at [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/).

**Certain Browsers or Browser Add-Ons.**
Certain browsers or browser add-ons may provide additional local data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to Cookies, and some of the content included on the online Topgolf Offerings may make use of this local storage.

**Web Beacons.**
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our online Topgolf Offerings and email messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a website or email can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the online Topgolf Offerings, to monitor how users navigate the online Topgolf Offerings, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.

**Embedded Scripts.**
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect data about your interactions with the online Topgolf Offerings, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online Topgolf Offerings and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**Data Collection from Mobile Devices.**
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in Software Development Kits ("**SDKs**") to collect data through mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior.
SDKs are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps including those that collect information from your device.

**Session Replay Technology.**
Topgolf may record through session replay technology your interactions with the Topgolf Offerings, such as what pages you visit on the Topgolf Offerings, how long you visit those pages, the links you click, your mouse movements, keystroke or scrolling activity or information you provide to us.
These tools may also record information when you interact with the Topgolf Offerings, such as by engaging in chat features or forum discussions.
If collected, we will use this data for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Topgolf Offerings and our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, online functionality, and operational purposes.


<a id="T2b"></a>

### b. Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties

**In General.**
We may also receive data about you from third parties, including other users who add you to a reservation, your coach in "Toptracer Coach", third party business partners (including companies that assist us with online advertising and analytics), and data providers.
For example, if you are on another website and agree to receive data from Topgolf, that website will forward your data to us so that we may contact you.
We may also supplement the data we collect with outside records from third parties — such as public databases, publicly available social media pages, joint marketing partners, and third parties who enhance the data we have about you for various purposes, such as to provide you with information, services, or products, to tailor our content and the offers we show you, or to enhance our products and services.
If you are an existing user of any Topgolf Offering, or later become a user of any Topgolf Offering, we may combine the data we receive from you with data about you from other sources to better understand your interests and preferences and better market our products and services to you.
We may combine the data we receive from third parties with data we collect through the Topgolf Offerings.
In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Notice to the combined data.
The data collected and stored by the third party is subject solely to the third party's privacy practices.

**Forward to a Friend Features and Data You Provide About Others.**
The Topgolf Offerings may give you the opportunity to forward information to a friend to facilitate your visit to one of our Locations.
If you send a friend a communication with the assistance of the Topgolf Offerings, the data you or they provide is used to facilitate the visit to our Locations and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person.
If you otherwise disclose any personal data relating to other people to us, you represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to use the data in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

**On-Premises Security Camera Data Collection**.
If you visit one of our Locations or other offline Topgolf Offerings, we may also collect data about you through our on-premises security cameras for security, loss prevention, employee safety, investigations, and other legitimate video surveillance purposes.

**Social Site Information Collection and Use.**
The online Topgolf Offerings may permit you to interact with a third party social media site ("**Social Site**"), for example, by including a button allowing you to link to a third party platform (such as Instagram or TikTok) or interacting with you through your social media account ("**Social Site Features**").
When you access a Social Site through our online Topgolf Offerings or use or access any of our products and services or communicate with us by way of a Social Site, including Social Sites where you can play our electronic games, both we and the Social Site may have access to certain data about you and your use of the online Topgolf Offerings and the Social Sites.
The Social Sites may collect data about your visit to the online Topgolf Offerings through Social Site Features we have integrated into the Topgolf Offerings.
The personal data you allow us to access varies by game and Social Site, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the Social Site.
You can control and find out more about these settings at the Social Site where you play our games or otherwise access our content or interact with us.
For example, we may access and store some or all of the following data, as allowed by you, the Social Site, and your preferences; your first and last name; your profile picture or its URL; your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available personal data such as name and profile photo; the user ID numbers for your friends that are also connected to us or our game(s); and the login email you provided to that Social Site when you registered.
Note that through the Social Site Features, these Social Sites may be able to collect certain data about your visits to the online Topgolf Offerings regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the Social Site Features and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the Social Site.
If you use the Social Site Features, your interaction and personal data may be publicly disclosed on the Social Site.

By accessing our products and services or otherwise communicating with us through a Social Site, you understand we will collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Notice the personal data that you have allowed the Social Site to provide to us, or that we collect through the Social Site, including through an Application Programming Interface ("**API**").

To manage the personal data we receive about you from the Social Site where you play our games or interact with us, you will need to follow the instructions at that Social Site for updating your personal data and changing your privacy settings.

Once we receive your personal data from a Social Site, that personal data is stored and used by us as set out in this Privacy Notice, and you may access and update that personal data as described below.


<a id="T2c"></a>

### c. Data You Provide Directly

We may ask you to provide data to use when you use the Topgolf Offerings.

**User Generated Content and Public Postings.**
The Topgolf Offerings may provide you the opportunity to register and participate in posting content publicly in forums, through interactive features such as leaderboards at Locations and TTR Facilities as well as on any digital platform such as our online Topgolf Offerings (including the Toptracer App) and Social Sites.
Those forums may ask you to create an account, may allow you to submit or post photographs, questions, comments, reviews, or other content (collectively "User Content").
If you participate in these features, certain data will be made available to other users or the public.
For example, your participation in the leaderboards at Locations and TTR Facilities will allow Topgolf to display the information you provide, including personal data, on the leaderboards at Topgolf Offerings.
organize certain submissions (such as images you upload) into public or private albums

**Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions.**
We may, with our third party partners, offer sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions (any of which, a "**Promotion**") that may require registration.
By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials).
If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion's terms or official rules (such as on a winner's list).
If you decide to enter a Promotion that is co-sponsored by a third party partner, the personal data that you provide will be shared with us and with them.
Their use of your personal data in this context is not governed by this Privacy Notice.

Promotions may also include contests or other promotions conducted by TTR Operators or at TTR Facilities - for example a closest-the-pin contest at your local range ("**TTR Operator Promotions**").
While TTR Operator Promotions are facilitated by the Toptracer Range system, they are solely arranged and promoted by TTR Operators, not by Topgolf.
TTR Operator Promotions are subject to the terms of entry set by the TTR Operator, which may include additional uses of your personal data, and you should read these carefully before participating.
If you enter a TTR Operator Promotion, your personal data will be shared with the TTR Operator in connection with the administration of such TTR Operator Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, as required by law, or as permitted by the TTR Operator's terms of entry (such as on a winner's list).

Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide such information, we and/or our service provider may submit that information to the appropriate government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information to defend against employment-related complaints.
Please note that we may utilize a careers portal that is operated by a third party, in which case, your registration and use of the careers portal may be subject to the third party's privacy practices as disclosed on the portal.

**Photos and Videos.**
We allow you to post photos and videos on the Topgolf Offerings or to submit them to us as described in the chart above.
Applicable laws and regulations may vary with respect to whether such materials are considered to be biometric information.
For clarity, we do not create a record of facial geometry from your photos or videos and do not use your photos or videos for the purposes of facial recognition, facial surveillance, or otherwise as a biometric identifier.
Please note, however, that to the extent that you post your photos or videos publicly on our Topgolf Offerings, or we share - as described elsewhere in this Privacy Notice - such materials with third parties who are permitted to use these materials in accordance with their own privacy policies, we do not control the actions of third parties, and their use of your photos or videos may differ from ours.

Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of TTR Operators and the personal data you disclose to TTR Operators is subject to their privacy practices.

Individuals who participate in our coaching platform ("**Toptracer Coach**") join an interactive coaching experience where coaches create custom lesson plans tailored to each unique student.
If you choose to participate in Toptracer Coach, your designated coach will have access to certain personal data, including your name, email address, account and profile information, performance data, and Toptracer Range usage data (including locations and dates/times) to provide them with an objective view of your current skillset, allowing your coach to follow-up on your performance, set new goals, and assist you with reaching your objectives.

**Business Transfers and Transitions.**
In case of a transfer or sale of some or all our business or assets, bankruptcy, or merger, or other corporate transaction (including, without limitation during the negotiation stage and in the course of any due diligence process), we may transfer or assign your personal data to those involved in such a transfer or sale of business or assets, which you agree that we may do without your further consent.
